## Trophy Images

Trophy images should be placed in the `trophyImages` folder. The default mapping is:

trophyMapping: {
    "Scottish League/Premier League/Premiership": "league.png",
    "Scottish Cup": "scottish-cup.png",
    "Scottish League Cup": "league-cup.png",
    "European Cup/Champions League": "european-cup.png",
    "Other": "trophy.png"
}
```
## Notes
-This module uses the (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.#Honours) as its source for Celtic`s  honours data. If the page structure changes or if there are issues with scraping, the module may not work correctly.
- If you want to add your teams trophy count you need to replace the scrapperURL with one which contains the relevant major trophy details for your team.
-If you want to add more trophy types, simply create an image file and add it to the `trophyImages` folder. Then, modify the `trophyMapping` object accordingly.

## Troubleshooting
- If no data appears check the web site URL you are using is correct
- If no trophys appear check that you have the correct image in the trophyImages folder.
- If the module shows your team have more trophys than they have actually won then you are probably a NewCo supporter ðŸ¤­  ![Banter Years](https://forum.pieandbovril.com/topic/249121-the-chronicles-of-the-banter-years-2012-%E2%88%9E/) 
- If you still have problems ensure that the debug option is set to true and check the console log for errors,
